## Configuration

In this section, you first must **add the primary instructions** that will allow users to use the app in their store, such as [installing the app](https://vtex.io/docs/recipes/store/installing-an-app) and configuring it using the account's admin. 

Remember to also **showcase any necessary disclaimer** related to the app in this section, such as the different behavior it may display during its configuration. 

## Modus Operandi *(not mandatory)*

There are scenarios in which an app can behave differently in a store, according to its configuration. It's crucial then to go through these **behavioral changes** in this section, allowing users to fully understand the **practical application** of the app in their store.

If you feel compelled to give further details, such as the app's **relationship with others**, don't hesitate to use this section.
